# JavaScript-Playground
Getting my hands dirty with JavaScript
- These are just notes I will keep whilst grokking JavaScript. Think of it as a journal of the things I learn.
- I plan to primarily rely on The Odin Project's resources for this lesson, but I may occasionally supplement my learning with JS books or tutorials when the need arises.
- I will reference helpful materials that I come across. 
- My intentions are that at by the end of this Sprint, I will be very fluent in JavaScript.
- Along the way I intend to write things I learn.
